; Overworld wild Pokemon: the mon that wander a route and start a *wild* battle when you step
; beside them. See docs/plan_overworld_wild_mon.md.

; wOverworldMonEncounters entries.
; The whole encounter -- species, form, shininess, level, DVs, held item -- is rolled once when the
; map is entered, and the battle reads it back instead of rolling again. That is the point of the
; struct: without it the overworld sprite and the battle roll separately and disagree, and a mon
; that looked ordinary in the grass turns up shiny once the battle starts.

DEF OW_MON_SPECIES rw ; 0 ; a 16-bit index; 0 means the slot is empty

; How close you have to get. Zero means the same tile: you walk *onto* one rather than up to it,
; which is why they do not block the player.
;
; It was 1, and that read badly. An object's map coordinates update when its step begins, not when
; the sprite arrives, so a wandering mon setting off towards you counted as adjacent while it was
; still visibly a tile away, and the battle started before it had moved. Standing on the tile has
; no such gap -- the player's own step has finished by the time the check runs.
DEF OW_MON_TRIGGER_DISTANCE EQU 0

; Per-entry perks, set in the area tables.
; shift_const, so each perk gets both a value for the tables (1, 2, 4, ...) and a matching _F bit
; number for the code. A plain 1, 2, 3 enumeration reads fine in the data and is a trap in the
; engine: `bit OW_PERK_EXTRA_SHINY, a` against value 2 tests bit 2, which is never the bit that
; was set, so the perk silently never fires and every mon rolls the ordinary odds.

	shift_const OW_PERK_EXTRA_SHINY ; a better shiny rate again, on top of the one they all get
; Water mon sink to the waist by default -- see OVERHEAD on SPRITEMOVEDATA_SWIM_WANDER_NOCLIP. This
