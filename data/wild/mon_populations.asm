; Which maps carry a population of wandering mon, and what it draws from.
; See docs/overworld_pokemon.md. pop_mon is weight, species, level range, form, perks.

MonPopulations:

; Hidden Grove: one rare species per visit, four of them out, every one with better shiny odds.
; Uniform in intent; 100 does not split eight ways, so the first four take the remainder.
