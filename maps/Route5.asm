; Wandering Pokemon. The species, form, shininess, level, DVs and held item are all rolled by
; RollOverworldMons when the map is entered; the sprite id only names which rolled slot this is.
; Palette 0 so they take the mon's own colors. Slots run static, then grass, then water -- the
; order RollOverworldMons fills them in -- so these have to stay numbered that way.
; The event flag is -1: whether one is standing here is decided by whether its slot holds a
; rolled mon, not by a flag.
